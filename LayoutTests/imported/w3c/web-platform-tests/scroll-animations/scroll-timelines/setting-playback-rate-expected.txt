PASS Zero current time is not affected by playbackRate set while the animation is in idle state.
PASS Zero current time is not affected by playbackRate set while the animation is in play-pending state.
PASS Initial current time is scaled by playbackRate set while scroll-linked animation is in running state.
FAIL The current time is scaled by playbackRate set while the scroll-linked animation is in play state. assert_approx_equals: values do not match for "The current time is scaled by the playback rate." expected 40 +/- 0.125 but got 20
PASS The playback rate set before scroll-linked animation started playing affects the rate of progress of the current time
PASS The playback rate affects the rate of progress of the current time when scrolling
PASS Setting the playback rate while play-pending does not scale current time.
FAIL Setting the playback rate while playing scales current time. assert_approx_equals: values do not match for "undefined" expected 50 +/- 0.125 but got 25
FAIL Setting the playback rate while playing scales the set current time. assert_approx_equals: values do not match for "undefined" expected 50 +/- 0.125 but got 25
PASS Negative initial playback rate should correctly modify initial current time.
PASS Reversing the playback rate while playing correctly impacts current time during future scrolls
PASS Zero initial playback rate should correctly modify initial current time.
FAIL Setting a zero playback rate while running preserves the start time assert_approx_equals: values do not match for "undefined" expected 0 +/- 0.125 but got 20
FAIL Reversing an animation with non-boundary aligned start time symmetrically adjusts the start time assert_approx_equals: values do not match for "undefined" expected 60 +/- 0.125 but got -0
