FAIL Playback rate affects whether active phase boundary is inclusive. assert_equals: Animation effect is in after phase when current time is 50% (progress is null with 'none' fill mode) expected (object) null but got (number) 0.2500000000000001
PASS Verify that (play -> pause -> play) doesn't change phase/progress.
PASS Pause in before phase, scroll timeline into active phase, animation should remain in the before phase
PASS Pause in before phase, set animation current time to be in active range, animation should become active. Scrolling should have no effect.
PASS Make scroller inactive, then set current time to an in range time
PASS Animation effect is still applied after pausing and making timeline inactive.
PASS Make timeline inactive, force style update then pause the animation. No crashing indicates test success.
