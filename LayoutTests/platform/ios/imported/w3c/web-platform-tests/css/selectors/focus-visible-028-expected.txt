This test checks that programmatically focusing an element after a click and using keyboard afterwards triggers :focus-visible matching.
If the user-agent does not claim to support the :focus-visible pseudo-class then SKIP this test.
Click the button below that says "Click me".
Once focused on the button that says "I will be focused programmatically", use "Left" or "Right" arrow keys to navigate through the button group
If any button within the group has a blue outline after using either arrow key, then the test result is SUCCESS. If the element has a green background after using either arrow key, then the test result is FAILURE.
